OpenCV sample programs:
Camera.py - A program that runs various algorithms on video files or live     
webcam feeds to detect objects/pedestrians. Currently does not work with 
usb camera on XU4

Circles.py - A basic object detection program that finds all circles in a     
given image.

Colors.py - A basic program that detects the presence of specific colored
objects in an image

To do:
- Add documentation for installing OpenCV and Caffe on ODROID XU4
- Add GPU modules to OpenCV programs via wrappers OR rewrite them in C++
- Add Caffe programs
